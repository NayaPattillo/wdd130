    <h2>Naya Pattillo</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Naya and my major is Applied Techology. I am also an artist and I sometimes do freelance work.
         I don't currently have a job since I am a full time student, but I hope that maybe soon I can work at the local library.
         I come from a big family, five sisters and one brother, and I am not married.</p>
    <p>I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and my favorite scripture is Moroni 7:19.</p>
    <p>I look forward to this semester with you all, thanks for reading!</p>
